Hey, my name is Damian. I started coding with 16 and still going. I can be really chaotic in real life, so my code can be, and will be messy in some projects too. I'm very intrested in Rocket Science and animals. I know, these two things don't fit well, but they are still very interesting on their own.
And one last fact about me to know: I can be distracted easily if my cat wants something from me.
